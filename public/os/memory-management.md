# Memory Management in Operating Systems

Memory management is one of the most important functions of an operating system. It keeps track of each and every memory location, regardless of whether it is allocated to some process or free.

## Virtual Memory

Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an "idealized abstraction of the storage resources that are actually available on a given machine" which "creates the illusion to users of a very large (main) memory."

### Paging

Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory.
